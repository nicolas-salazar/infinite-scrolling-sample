**Create infinite scrolling (lazy loading) of images in a page - deferred fetching of images until the user scrolls near the end of the list.**

# Getting started with Nicolás's resolution! 😎 
There are only a couple things you need to know about my code before starting:

- I used this cool [Unsplash Api](https://unsplash.com/developers) for getting random photos.

  >   [ALERT ⚠️] **Unsplash api** is a free api for getting cool photos but, in order to have big access, the guys there may approve my app first. So, as I don't have time enough for waiting for approval, got what they call a **demo** api key, which allows me to fire 50 request/hr. In short therms: don't abuse 🥲.


  If you get out of quota, I built a cool solution for you 😁. Previously fired 90+ photo requests and saved the responses on `mockData.js` file. For using it, just go to `index.js` file and change DEV_MODE variable to true.
  
      2. DEV_MODE = true

  It will *simulate* photos fetching so wait times will be there, but without depending on api key. I'd preferred to use an ENV variable but you know, I'm on a simple HTML file.
